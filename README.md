# Excel Project 

Welcome to my Excel portfolio, in this repository, you will find Excel Project  that highlight my skills in exploratory data analysis, visualization and data cleaning.    

## Project Overview  
This repository contains  key Excel Projects :  

1. This project is an interactive sales dashboard built using Microsoft Excel to analyze and visualize bike sales data.  The dashboard provides key insights into sales performance, trends, and customer behavior, enabling data-driven decision-making
2.  This project involves the analysis of a school survey dataset containing information about students' performance in math, reading, and writing. The dataset also includes various demographic and academic-related factors such as gender, parental education level, lunch typem, and test preparation   

## Project 1: Bikes sales
### Description  

This project involves the cleaning and visualization of a bike sales dataset to derive meaningful insights regarding the sales performance. The dataset was cleaned and standardized for consistency. Pivot tables and charts were used to explore trends and visualize insights.

## Key Features  
### Data cleaning & Transformation  
- Removing duplicate data
- Grouping the age into age brackets for simplicity
- Standardized the gender column by replacing abbreviation (M AND F) with full Labels (Male and Female) for better readability and consistency

### Data analysis and visualization
- Created pivot tables to analyze the dataset allowing for better analysis of trends and patterns in the data
- Used pivot charts(bar charts ,line charts etc)  to represent key findings visually

## Key Excel Features Used
- Pivot Tables  
- Charts (e.g., Bar, Line)  
- Slicers  
- Formulas (e.g., if, Substitute)  

## Tool used
- Microsoft Excel

## Project 2: School survey
### Description  

This project focuses on cleaning and visualizing a school survey dataset to uncover valuable insights about student scores. The data was refined and standardized for uniformity, and pivot tables along with charts were employed to analyze trends and present the findings visually.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between student demographics and their academic performance using Microsoft Excel. Key insights were drawn using pivot tables and charts.
